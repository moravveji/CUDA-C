# Exercises in CUDA/C
The codes here are based on the following (interesting) book:
*Professional CUDA C Programming* by Cheng J., Grossman M. and McKrecher T., 2014 <http://www.hds.bme.hu/~fhegedus/C++/Professional%20CUDA%20C%20Programming.pdf>. All these codes are inspired by the code samples, listings, and exercises from the book. The source codes are organized based on the flow of the material in the book, and are sometimes enumerated based on the same listing numbers therein.
