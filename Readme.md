# CUDA/C Code Samples

## About
In this repository, I collect different CUDA codes that I have put together. The sole purpose of this repo has been to keep track of **learning CUDA as a hobby**.

## Contents
+ `book-exercises`: which collects code samples from a CUDA book

## Also
I also have a separate repository for [CUDA Fortran](https://github.com/moravveji/CUDA-Fortran) sample codes.
